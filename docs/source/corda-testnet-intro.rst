The Corda Testnet
================================================================

.. contents::

The Corda Testnet is an open public network of Corda nodes on the internet. It is designed to be a complement to *the* Corda Network where any entity can transact real world value with any other counterparty in the context of any application. The Corda Testnet is designed for "non-production" use in a genuine global context of Corda nodes, including but not limited to Cordapp development, multi-party testing, demonstration and showcasing of applications and services, learning, training and development of the Corda platform technology and specific applications of Corda.

The Corda Testnet is based on exactly the same technology as the main Corda Network, but can be joined on a self-service basis through the automated provisioning system described below.

The Corda Testnet is currently in private beta. Interested parties can request in invitation to join the Corda Testnet by completing a short request form (see below).
